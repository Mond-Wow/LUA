 This script automatically exchanges a player's gold for Gold Items after killing a mob if the player possesses over 200k gold.
For example, if a player has 199k gold and gains an additional 2k gold from looting that mob, their gold will not be converted to items. However, upon killing the next mob, their gold will be exchanged for Gold Items.    
Mond-Wow utilizes an Auto Loot system. As a result, after killing a mob, gold is instantly added to the player's inventory, enabling the script to operate immediately upon the first kill.

Setup:
1. Open the file and search For ITEM_ID .
2. Change 111111 to your item ID.
3. Search for itemCountToAdd and enter the amount of the item that should be added to player. (Example : 4x 50k gold Item).
4. Save the file and place it into your Eluna folder in your repack.
5. Reload eluna or restart worldserver.
